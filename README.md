### Hi there, I'm Artem Papazian 👋

#### Frontend Developer | Tech Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner

Welcome to my GitHub page! I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with 5+ years of experience, currently based in Valencia, Spain 🇪🇸.
I specialize in building scalable, high-performance web apps using Angular, React, and advanced video streaming tech like WebRTC, HLS, and MSE.

#### What I Do 🚀
- 🛠 Built a custom video player from scratch that handles WebRTC, HLS, and MSE — used for live and archived playback for a system with 100+ cameras
- 🔁 Migrated legacy AngularJS apps to modern Angular
- 🧩 Developed admin panels with role-based access, custom permission systems, and LDAP integration for secure logins
- 🔐 Implemented authentication with Ory/Kratos, structured large-scale apps with Nx and microfrontends
- 🔧 Also got into backend: built WebSocket bridges, created REST APIs, and worked with Node.js and Golang


#### Beliefs and Goals 🌟

- I firmly believe in the transformative power of technology and aspire to be an active architect of the IT future.
- Collaborative teamwork and managing complex processes to deliver tangible results are where I thrive.
- Continuously learning and evolving in the field of development to bring innovative solutions to the table.

🌍 I speak English (C1), Russian (native), and I’m currently learning Spanish 🇪🇸

### 🏃‍♂️ Outside of work, I’m into:
 • Long-distance running (currently train for a full marathon)
 • Traveling and exploring new places
 • Discovering great food spots 🍽
 • Reading about tech, psychology, and a bit of everything 📚
